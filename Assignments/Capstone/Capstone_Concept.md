### Assignment: Capstone Game Concept Presentation

#### Objective:
Present your game concept to the class in a 10-minute group presentation. This presentation will serve as an opportunity to articulate your design ideas, inspirations, chosen mechanics, and plan for execution. Focus on communicating your vision clearly and demonstrating your approach to creating a minimum viable product (MVP).

#### Presentation Structure (10 minutes total):

1. **Game Concept Overview (2 minutes)**
   - Briefly introduce your game idea
   - Describe the core gameplay and key mechanics
   - Explain your primary design goals

2. **Inspirations and Influences (2 minutes)**
   - Discuss 2-3 games that serve as inspiration
   - Explain how these inspirations inform your design choices

3. **Mechanics and Gameplay Demo (3 minutes)**
   - Present a visual representation of your core mechanics (e.g., sketches, diagrams, or simple prototypes)
   - Explain how these mechanics will create the intended player experience

4. **Development Plan (2 minutes)**
   - Outline your process for creating the MVP within the given timeframe
   - Describe how you're dividing tasks among team members
   - Identify key milestones in your development timeline

5. **Challenges and Learning Objectives (1 minute)**
   - Discuss anticipated challenges and how you plan to address them
   - Identify skills or knowledge the team needs to acquire to create the prototype

#### Submission Requirements:
- **Presentation Time:** 10 minutes (strict limit)
- **Format:** Live presentation with visual aids (e.g., slides, sketches, diagrams)
- **Team Participation:** All team members should have a speaking role

#### Grading Rubric: (Total 10 Points)

1. **Game Concept Clarity (2 points)**
   - Clearly communicates the game idea and core gameplay
   - Design goals are well-defined and achievable

2. **Inspiration and Originality (2 points)**
   - Effectively references inspirations and explains their influence
   - Demonstrates how the concept builds upon or diverges from inspirations

3. **Mechanics Presentation (2 points)**
   - Clearly explains core mechanics and how they create the intended experience
   - Visual aids effectively illustrate the gameplay concepts

4. **Development Planning (2 points)**
   - Presents a realistic and well-thought-out development plan
   - Demonstrates effective task division among team members

5. **Challenge Awareness and Learning Goals (1 point)**
   - Shows awareness of potential obstacles and has strategies to address them
   - Identifies relevant learning objectives for creating the MVP

6. **Presentation Quality (1 point)**
   - Well-organized and engaging presentation
   - Effective use of the allotted time
   - All team members contribute meaningfully

#### Tips for Success:
- **Focus on Clarity:** Ensure your concept is easy to understand within the time limit.
- **Be Realistic:** Your plans should be achievable given your current skills and the time available.
- **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Use visual aids to illustrate your concepts and mechanics.
- **Practice:** Rehearse your presentation to ensure smooth delivery within the time limit.
- **Be Prepared for Questions:** The class or instructor may have a brief Q&A after your presentation.

Remember, the goal is to articulate your ideas clearly and demonstrate your approach to creating an MVP, not to present a fully polished game concept.
