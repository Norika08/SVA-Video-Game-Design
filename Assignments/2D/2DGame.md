### Assignment Prompt: 2D Game Group Project in Godot

#### Objective:
Design and create a 2D game using Godot 4 that can be played and completed within a 10-15 minute timeframe. Your game should be engaging, embody clear objectives, and provide an enjoyable experience for players.

#### Constraints:
- **Game Environment:** The game must be suitable for single-player or local multiplayer gameplay. Single Player reccomended.
- **Duration:** The game's total playtime should not exceed 15 minutes, ensuring a concise yet engaging experience.
- **Clear Objective:** The game must have a well-defined objective, providing players with a clear goal or set of goals.
- **Rule-set:** Incorporate a simple yet effective set of game mechanics and rules that are easy for players to understand and interact with.

#### Submission Requirements:
- **[2D Game Concept](2D_Concept.md)** - Submit a 500-750 word paper that:
    - Describes the design goals for your game.
    - Describes the core gameplay you hope to accomplish.
    - References any games that serve as inspiration.
    - Outlines your development process going forward (How are you planning on making the game with the time you have? How are you splitting up the work?)
    - What major challenges do you anticipate? What do you need to learn in order to create a playable prototype?
  - Outlines your development process going forward (How are you planning on making the game with the time you have?)
- **2D Game Prototype** - Submit a digital version of your 2D game developed in Godot 4.

#### Grading Criteria: (Total 20 Points)
- **Meeting stated design goals (0-4):** Does the game have a clear objective, perspective(character/world/universe), ending condition and emptional impact?
- **Tutorial (0-4):** Does the game itself teach players how to play it? When conducting in class playtests, you will not be allowed to explain how to play the game, so make sure players can learn how to play the game just by interacting with it.
- **Individual Coding Contribution (0-4):** Each member of the group should author at least one scene that has a script that contributes to the gameplay. This should be evident on github. Students will be individually graded for this section.
- **Robust(0-4):** Can the game run from beginning to end without crashing?
- **Polish (0-4):** Spending a little extra effort on visuals, sounds or Juice can go a long way!

#### Tips for Success:
- **Begin with Basics:** Start with simple game mechanics and gradually add complexity. Remember, a well-executed simple game is better than a complex one that's unfinished or unplayable.
- **Iterative Design:** Utilize playtesting feedback to refine gameplay and mechanics. Don't be afraid to make changes based on player experiences.
- **Utilize Godot Resources:** Take advantage of Godot's documentation, tutorials, and community forums to overcome technical challenges.
- **Collaborate and Communicate:** Work closely with your group members, dividing tasks based on skills and interests, and maintain open lines of communication throughout the project development.
