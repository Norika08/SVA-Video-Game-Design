# 2D Game Concept Paper

As a group write a 500-750 word paper that:

 - Describes the design goals for your game.

 - Describes the core gameplay you hope to accomplish.

 - References any games that serve as inspiration.

 - Outlines your development process going forward (How are you planning on making the game with the time you have? How are you splitting up the work?)

 - What major challenges do you anticipate? What do you need to learn in order to create a playable prototype?


This will be worth 10 points. 2 points will be awarded for answering each of the above questions.


Since this is intended to guide your design process, it must be submitted on the deadline.


 **Late submissions will not be accepted.**
