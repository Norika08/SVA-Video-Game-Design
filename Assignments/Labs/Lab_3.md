## Lab 3: Collective Edits
The following lab is a group project to be completed with you 2D game design group. The lab will be graded pass fail and everyone in the group will receive the same grade. Work together!

Please create a Github Repository that:
- Lists each group member as a collaborator
- Has a godot project with a main scene
  - This scene should have instances of different nested scenes contributed by each collaborator. To accomplish this each group member should:
    - create their own scene
    - make an instance of that scene in the main scene
    - commit and push their changes to the repository
- At least one branch.

Submit the link to the repository page on blackboard.

This repository can (and probably should!) evolve into your 2D game repository. Getting this workflow established will really help you with that project.

## Grading
